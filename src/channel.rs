                // So, this is a bit complicated. The issue is that we are mixing atomic (`load`,
                // `store`) with non atomic (mod, decrement) operations. Why is this a problem?
                // Well, when performing a `fetch_add` for example, the operation takes place as a
                // single atomic transaction (the fetch and the add happen simultaneously, and its
                // changes can be seen across threads as long as you use `AcRel` ordering). This is
                // not the case here: we `load` an atomic, we compute a change and then we `store`
                // it. Critically, we can only guarantee the ordering of atomic operations across
                // threads. We cannot guarantee that our (non-atomic) computation of `strt_new` and
                // `size_new` will be synchronized with other threads. In other words, it is
                // possible for the value of `start_and_size` to _change_ between our `load` and
                // `store`. Atomic fences will _not_ solve this problem since they only guarantee
                // relative ordering between atomic operations.
                //
                // `compare_exchange` allows us to work around this problem by updating an atomic
                // _only if its value has not changed from what we expect_. In other words, we ask
                // it to update `strt_and_size` only if `strt_and_size` has not been changed by
                // another thread in the meantime. If this is not the case, we re-try the whole
                // operations (checking `size`, computing `strt_new`, `size_new`) with the updated
                // information.
                //
                // We are making two assumptions here:
                //
                // 1. We will not loop indefinitely.
                // 2. The time it takes us to loop is very small, such that there is a good chance
                //    we will only ever loop a very small number of times before settling on a
                //    decision.
                //
                // Assumption [1] is satisfied by the fact that if other readers or writers keep
                // updating the message queue, we will eventually reach the condition `size == 0` or
                // we will succeed in a write. We can assume this since the operations between loop
                // cycles are very simple (in the order of single instructions), therefore it is

/// > uses state reduction techniques to avoid combinatorial explosion of the number of possible

///
/// # Running Loom
///
/// To run the tests below, first enter:
///
/// ```bash
/// LOOM_LOCATION=1 \
///     LOOM_CHECKPOINT_INTERVAL=1 \
///     LOOM_CHECKPOINT_FILE=test_name.json \
///     cargo test test_name --release --features loom
/// ```
///
/// This will begin by running loom with no logs, checking all possible permutations of
/// multithreaded operations for our program (actually this tests _most_ permutations, with
/// limitations in regard to [SeqCst] and [Relaxed] ordering, but since we do not use those loom
/// will be exploring the full concurrent permutations). If an invariant is violated, this will
/// cause the test to fail and the fail state will be saved under `LOOM_CHECKPOINT_FILE`.
///
/// > We do not enable logs for this first run as loom might simulate many thousand permutations
/// > before finding a single failing case, and this would polute `stdout`. Also, we run in
/// > `release` mode to make this process faster.
///
/// Once a failing case has been identified, resume the tests with:
///
/// ```bash
/// LOOM_LOG=debug \
///     LOOM_LOCATION=1 \
///     LOOM_CHECKPOINT_INTERVAL=1 \
///     LOOM_CHECKPOINT_FILE=test_name.json \
///     cargo test test_name --release --features loom
/// ```
///
/// This will resume testing with the previously failing case. We enable logging this time as only a
/// single iteration of the test will be run before the failure is caught.
///
/// > Note that if ever you update the code of a test, you will then need to delete
/// > `LOOM_CHECKPOINT_FILE` before running the tests again. Otherwise loom will complain about
// > having reached an unexpected execution path.
///
/// # Complexity explosion
///
/// Due to the way in which loom checks for concurrent access permutations, execution time will grow
/// exponentially with the size of the model. For this reason, it might be necessary to limit the
