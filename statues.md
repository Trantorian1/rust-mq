    Bombs will lauch in 3. Bombs will launch in 2. Bombs will launch in 1.
Bombs are flying. People died tonight while I stayed within the safe confines 
of my home. Perhaps they thought so too.
    Far in the distance, visions of blood red skies assail me. A distant,
roaring detonation, felt like a close thud, sunrise at night and the sun 
drawing nearer, burning the souls of the innocent in holy fire. Holocaust by 
uranium and the piercing cries of a million broken statues, feeling the hollow
cost of war.
